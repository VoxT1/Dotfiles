This is my repository to store config files for whenever I may need them, and you are free to use them yourself!

* Files with dots
/Dotfiles/ are files that are "hidden" due to the dot in front of their names. They specifically refer to configuration files for a Linux system; window managers, file managers, text editors, most programs have a configuration file or two in the .config/ folder. By saving one's dotfiles, their configs can be deployed on any system, perhaps with some minor tweaking.

* My Distribution of Choice
Since October of 2020, Gentoo Linux has been my go-to distribution, and as such this repo is full of different system files that may be specific to Gentoo. These files are kept in the ~/.sys/gentoo/ directory.

* My Window Managers
I tend to hop between different Window Managers and Desktop Environments. It's obviously more useful to save the configs for Window Managers, since they are a pain in the ass to set up in the first place. Right now, my favorite Window Manager is XMonad, a dynamic tiling WM written in Haskell.
